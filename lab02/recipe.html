            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease or line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Combine the sugar, beaten egg and sour cream together. Mix in the flour, baking soda and salt. Blend thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half and form each half into a long roll. (Note: If your kitchen is warm, keep the half of dough you're not working with in the refrigerator.)</li>
            <li>Cut off a narrow slice of dough. Roll lightly with hands on lightly floured board into pencil-like strip about 7 inches long. Form into a figure "8", and pinch ends together. Place on cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
