<h3>If I am allergic to peanuts, can I eat Jelly Belly jelly beans?</h3>
<p class="answer">We do not use peanuts as an ingredient in any confections manufactured in any of our plants. 
    However, there are a limited number of confections that we offer that are packed in our facility but are produced by other companies, and some of the facilities they use also process peanuts. 
    Therefore, please look for the term “Peanut Free” on packages and bulk bin labels to ensure that the product is peanut free. </p>

<p class="answer">It takes 7 to 14 days to make a Jelly Belly bean, and we're not kidding! 
    It's an involved process carried out by master candy makers using both modern methods and age-old techniques. </p>
