        <p>At the Event Production Crew, we believe in working together to reach our goals and empowering each other to be our
            best. Together we work to put on every single event that happens on campus, and we couldn't do that without student
            employees who go the extra mile to learn technical skills such as lighting, audio, and video production, and
            more. Here you will find resources for training on these technical subjects so that you can advance your skills
            and learn to run events.</p>
        <p>Event Services student staff goes through extensive training sessions each semester covering general procedures,
            safety, and specialized knowledge for their unique duties on campus. Each team also has a student supervisor
            that works as a team leader and coordinates with each team's respective staff supervisor.Together we work to
            put on the best events we can every day of the year.</p>
